# Companionship Care Personae

These personae have been created to help people contributing to this Companionship Care understand something of the sort of people who might use the application. We find it easier to keep peopleâ€™s needs in mind if we can picture them and have a story attached.

So while these are not real people and do not capture all the reasons people might use this software, they provide an entry point to thinking about what we need to be aware of as we build it.

Read through them, get to know them and consider what would add value to their experience of using Companionship Care. Ask yourself, what would make it easier for them to use? What would make them want to keep using it and tell others about it?

#### Demographics:

67-year-old single woman | retired | homeowner

#### Personal motto:

"I have interests, I am interesting, I need people to share them with".

#### Bio:

Husband died four years ago. Six months before his death, he had retired, and they had moved across the country. They're one child moved abroad a decade ago, visiting every two years. Astrid had not worked for seven years and had lost contact with all but two friends. However, they now live four hours away.

#### Personality traits:

Astrid is generally an outgoing person, comfortable making small talk. She finds it difficult to get beyond being an acquaintance to develop closer friendships.

#### Goals:

She would like to have people in her new hometown to contact her and invite her to things.

#### Frustrations:

The social cliques in the town seem so hard to break into. She feels like they have all been friends for so long, she will never have a point of connection with any of them. Her new hobbies (painting and reading) don't help her connect with other people in her new town.

#### Demographics:

64-year-old married man | retired | homeowner

#### Personal motto:

"I'm unsure what I want to do, but I do know I want to connect".

#### Bio:

Sustained a back injury at work six years ago forcing him into premature retirement from a manual labouring role. His wife still works full-time and has an active social life so is regularly out. His mates from work dropped off the radar once he left.

#### Characteristics:

He was an outgoing person when he was working, but in the years since the injury, he has become more withdrawn. Many of his interests are no longer possible given his injury. The result of less social interaction, less hobbies, and less physical activity means he is suffering from depression.

#### Goals:

Hubert wants to develop new interests and make new friendships.

#### Frustrations:

He is limited in activities he's able to do, unsure of where to look for connection, and now lacks the confidence to forge new friendships.

## Sunan Sirichai

#### Demographics:

71-year-old single homosexual man | working part-time | renting

#### Personal motto:

"If you've got something to give, give it".

#### Bio:

Sunan has moved a lot in his adult life. His most recent move was after his husband of 10 years passed away a year ago. Now renting a modest apartment, in the city where he drives his cab, he feels like there is much business around him, and people everywhere, but no one he can call a friend. He is starting to lack motivation for cooking, and his house is not as tidy as it once was. He suspects he is suffering from a little depression.

#### Personality traits:

Generally, an outgoing, happy man, Sunan values people. He takes pride in his work as he sees it as a type of service. Despite this, he is not good at asking for help.

#### Goals:

Close friendships. People he can call on, and people who will call on him.

#### Frustrations:

Sunan feels judged by his cultural background, his sexuality, and his age, making it difficult to open up to people. He's confident that if he found people with common interests, they would accept him, but this has been hard.

## Matilda Murphy


<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6224254/pexels-photo-6224254.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" width="300"/>

#### Demographics:

34-year-old woman | married with two children | working full-time

#### Personal motto:

"My mum's been there for me my whole life. Now it's my turn".

#### Bio:

Matilda met her husband when she moved across the country to study. Recently they had to move back to her hometown to care for her elderly mother. Her dad passed away several years ago, and her mother's health has since deteriorated. Matilda now juggles a new job, her house, her two young children (and her husband), and caring for her mother. There are appointments, errands, occasional outings, and general home duties all to be scheduled and managed. There is certainly no time for her own social life.

#### Personality traits:

Matilda is hard working and dutiful. She puts other people first to a fault, often not looking after her own wellbeing.

#### Goals:

Just a little support in caring for her mother is all Matilda is looking for. She would so like to spend some quality time with her children and husband, as well as with her friends.

#### Frustrations:

There is no one Matilda feels like she can ask to help her. Everyone around her is so busy and have their own concerns. And while she doesn't like to admit it, she is feeling tired and doesn't have the energy to deal with the paperwork for government help.
